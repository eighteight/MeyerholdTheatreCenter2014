This is a repository for the Engineering Art in Theatre course read at the Meyerhold Theatre Center in 2014

This course consists of two parts Theoretical and Experimental.

Theoretical part consists of Lectures in the Lectures forum

The following is the list of the intended exercises (only some of them are solved in the corresponding folders of this repository)

1. Color Tracking using a PS3 EYE or built in cam.
2. Kinect as a video cam (RGB and depth, with depth cut-offs), using Quartz Composer kinect patch
3. Kinect as a distance meter and a DMX interactive light (thanks @feinsinn), using Quartz Composer kinect patch, USB to DMX adapter
4. Arduino + HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance meter + video player controlled by distance to an object. REF -- need to learn to interface arduino with Isadora.
5. Theremin (hope to borrow one from the Moscow Theremin Center) to control some video effect (plus perhaps ableton live -- do not know yet how to interface the theremin I might be getting)
6. Syphon Screen Capture to input from videos from youtube/skype.
7. Syphon as an interface to a DSLR
8. OSC messaging Isadora from a smartphone (TouchOSC on IOS, android --???)
9. Streaming from a smartphone camera into Isadora (EpocCam on IOS, android -???)
10. Using pulsecontroller as a MIDI input into Isadora to control some effect.
11. Hacking PS3 EYE to accept only infrared light, infrared tracking of actors using IR lit background (two regular lights with IR filters -- what filters should I get ???)
12. Using infrared light and infrared camera to create "tunnels through walls" (IR camera picks up the IR light reflected from walls and uses that blob as a mask on the video projected on the wall).
13. Using rotary encoder and Arduino, create a dynamic projection mapping of a rotating object.
