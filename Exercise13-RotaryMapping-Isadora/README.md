Exercise 13

Use rotary encoder, arduino and Isadora to dynamically projection-map a rotating object

Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX6JcybgDFo

Prerequisites:

Isadora http://troikatronix.com/download/isadora-pre-releases/

Arduino software: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software



Arduino hardware (I used Uno r3)

Rotary encoder (I used COM-10596) https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10596

Reference:

There seems to be a library for this encoder
